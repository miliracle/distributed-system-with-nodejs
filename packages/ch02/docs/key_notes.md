## HTTP Compression

“Support HTTP compression between the Node.js server and the client, especially for third-party internet traffic. Node.js is not efficient for compression; handle it outside the Node.js process whenever possible.”

## HTTPS

"decript and encrypt data in transit" - same with HTTP Compression, should be handled outside the Node.js process.

## Layer 8

### GraphQL

### RPC
